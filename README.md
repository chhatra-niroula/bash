# Linux Service Management
Linux service management
As you can probably imagine, the task of managing the system services—the programs required to
run so that your computer is usable to you—is not a trivial one. The software that runs them must be
stable and robust. This, and the fact that the system is expected to start rarely, especially on servers,
made the Linux-adopted solution survive for decades. The increasing need to start services in parallel
(through the emergence and widespread use of many threaded CPUs) and more intelligently gave way
to several implementations of the new init system, which we will cover next.
systemd
systemd is a service manager for Linux that is able to manage services that start with the operating
system. It replaces traditional init scripts. It is responsible for starting and stopping system services,
managing system state, and logging system events. It has become the default init system for many
popular Linux distributions, including CentOS, Fedora Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL),
and Ubuntu Linux.
This service manager is responsible for controlling the initialization of the system itself (services
required for the Linux OS), starting and stopping system services, and managing system resources.
It provides another way of managing services and other system components, and it allows system
administrators to configure and customize the behavior of their systems in a more standardized way
than with System V (SysV) init.
One of the key features of systemd is its ability to start services in parallel, which can significantly
reduce the boot time of a system. It also includes a number of tools for managing and monitoring
system services.
Another thing systemd is praised for is the uniformity of service configurations it has finally brought
to the Linux world. In every Linux distribution, the systemd configuration files are delivered to
the same path; they look the same. There are, however, still some differences depending on the path
binaries are being installed to. systemd is also better at knowing whether a process is running,
making it more difficult to end up in a situation where we can’t start a process because of stale files.
One of the major advantages of systemd is its awareness of dependencies. The service (running
program under systemd control) configuration contains information about all the other services
it depends on and can also point to services that depend on it. What’s more, the service can inform
systemd about which targets it requires to run: if your service needs the network to be up and
running, you can put this information into the configuration, and systemd will ensure your daemon
will be brought up only after the network is properly configured.Understanding Linux services in detail
The following is a list of some of the tools and utilities that are provided as part of systemd:
• systemd: This is the main system and service manager. It is the main program that controls
the initialization and management of services and other system components.
• systemctl: This is the command-line utility for managing system services and other system
components. It can be used to start, stop, restart, enable, and disable services, as well as to view
the status of services and other system components.
• journalctl: This is used for viewing and manipulating the system log, which is managed
by systemd. It can be used to view log messages, filter log messages based on various criteria,
and export log data to a file.
• coredumpctl: This is a utility, as the name suggests, that helps retrieve core dumps from
systemd’s journal.
• systemd-analyze: This can be used for analyzing the boot performance of a system. It
measures the time it takes for a system to boot, as well as the time it takes to identify potential
bottlenecks and performance issues.
• systemd-cgls: This is a command-line utility for viewing the control group hierarchy on a
system. Control groups, or cgroups, are used by systemd to manage system resources and
to isolate processes from one another.
• systemd-delta: This is a command-line utility for analyzing the differences between the
default configuration files provided by systemd and any local modifications made to these files.
• systemd-detect-virt: This is a command-line utility for detecting the virtualization
environment in which a system is running. It can be used to determine whether a system is
running in a virtual machine (VM), a container, or on bare metal.
• systemd-inhibit: This is a command-line utility for preventing certain system actions,
such as suspending or shutting down the system, from being performed.
• systemd-nspawn: This is a command-line utility for running processes in lightweight
containers. It can be used to create and manage containers, as well as to execute processes
within containers.
This is just a list of more common tools and utilities that are provided as part of systemd. There are
many more, but we will not cover them here.
